## Getting Started

My github with challenges from zybooks

I am a college student with some prior coding in C++.
This represents my journey learning Java!

If anyone happens to come across this, and has comments, 
please ask at sha@prisov.com

If you have any tips or study guides please share!
Will gladly accept and information I don't mind if
it's advanced or beginner there is always room to 
learn something new or build skills upon.

Thank You â™¥
