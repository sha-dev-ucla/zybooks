## Getting Started


My github with challenges from zybooks


I am a college student with some prior coding in C++.
This represents my journey learning Java!

8/20
Working on using better names which I know shouldn't be trouble but
I find myself arguing with myself on best variable names to use to make
code look more elegant


8/22
Learned in class about using final keyword for static values which makes
sense to use. It's very similar transfer from static in C++


8/24
Looked back at code and doing a lot of learning from mistakes such as using values
rather than variables when working with assignment functions. I didn't realize as
this is not something I did from C++ programs


8/26
I have written code to the best of my ability to compile without warnings.
I would simply insert full libraries rather then a target in that
specific library which resulted in compiler warnings.


8/27
These past few days I have found a function called scnr.close() for example that
also removes warnings when I compile. This is specifically a java Scanner not closed
warning which I will need to dive deeper on. On first impressions I'm not sure
if it's similar to freeing memory in C++ but will most definitely look into it.



My goals from this zybooks course and CS49J class:
Prepare for Data Structures and Algorithms (CS 146)
Know entry level java like the back of my hand
Learn how to implent java perhaps to build GUI
Learn how java API works and implementation
Write cleaner more efficient code (always a goal)
